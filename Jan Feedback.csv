I enjoyed the discussion and appreciated that I received a personal message informing my of the decision not to proceed with me and then I was able to get some personal feedback from the hiring manager.  All of this is much better and more honest than those organizations that send a form note saying how strong your credentials are an to keep look at their site for future opportunities.  If you don't know why you weren't chosen why would you ever believe there is a future potential and there is no way to find out because the message came from a no-reply email address.  Thus I would say your process is significantly better and more honest that most others.",4 - Satisfied,"I have exchanged messages with the hiring manager and am still uncertain regarding the decision as it was because they found someone else that they felt more closely met their needs.  That is completely reasonable; however, it was my understanding that there were four positions open to be filled so I don't understand how finding a person who has more segment experience would affect a decision on me.  And while I would like to understand this better, I understand that not all engagements work out the way we like and it isn't necessarily for negative reasons.  Should things change in the future I would certainly welcome re-engagement.",4 - Satisfied,4 - Satisfied

I liked that each interview used a different style / was conducted for a specific purpose. 

I didn't expect four interview rounds. Whilst I didn't mind this, I wonder if this could be costing CC talent to competitors running less rounds over shorter periods of time. I believe from screening to offer it was roughly a month for me. 

Overall, interviewing with CC was a really positive experience and I think each interviewer had a great way of highlighting and positively reacting to the questions answered well. This gives interviewees some positive takeaways when unsure of the overall outcome. ",5 - Very satisfied,4 - Satisfied
